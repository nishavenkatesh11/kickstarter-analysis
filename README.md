## Overview of the Project

The overview of the project defines the purpose and background of this analysis.

### Background

Louiseâ€™s play "Fever" came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. She wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

As Louise is looking to make data informed decisions for a more successful campaign during her next attempt, I have looked at the data available to provide Louise with the times of year to launch her Theatre category campaign with the highest probability of success, and the campaign fnding goals within the Plays subcategory that see the highest probability for success.

### Theatre Category Outcomes Based on Launch Dates

The enclosed chart shows the outcomes of campaigns in the Theatre category based on their launch dates. This chart shows the probability of successful campaigns based on which months within which the campaign's launch dates fall.

### Play Subcategory Outcomes based on Campaign Funding Goals

The enclosed chart shows the outcomes of campaigns in the Plays subcategory based on their funding goals. This chart shows the probability of successful and failed campaigns based on what range within which the campaign's funding goals fall.

### Challenges
There were no difficulties encountered during this analysis. However, these results include data from variety of countries. Therefore, Louise will need to ensure that she is creating rewards that are accessible and desired by a global audience. If not, she may find that demographics included within these analysis are not interested in supporting her campaign because the return on their investment is not meaning ful to them. For instance, the analysis includes data from both US and and UK supporters. If one of the campaign benefits Louise offers is the opportunity to see her play's live production, then she will alienate supporters for that donation tier from regions that are too far from the city where her play will be produced. If Louise would like to target a more regional demographic, the analysis can be redone to filter the enclosed results to her region(s) of interest. 

## Results

Based on my analysis, I have the following recommendations for Louise.

### Insights based on the Theatre Category Outcomes by Launch Dates

* She should launch her campaign in May, June or July to see the highest likeliness of success. According to the data, a May launch date will see the highest probability of success within the Theatre category.

* She should avoid the October to January timeframe because these months see the lowest likeliness of success campaign success for plays. These are likely due to the expenses incurred by most during leading up to the Christmas season. October has a low probability of success for a corresponding high probability of failure within the Theatre category.

### Insights based on the Plays Subcategory Outcomes by Funding Goals

* She should set her campaign funding goal to be ether less than $15,000.00 or $33,000.00 and $42,000.00. These are funding goal ranges where the probability of success are greater than the probability of failure within the Pla subcategory. 

### Limitations

This analysis uses the abosolute funding value for campaigns and acknowledges that there are currency variations depending on which region the campaign is targetting. Therefore, the Outcomes Based on Goals chart should be read in terms of relative funding values rather than an accurate reflection of exact revenue in USD, based on currency exchanges.
